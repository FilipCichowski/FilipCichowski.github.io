## Introduction

As a volunteer, I worked on the project the details of which I cannot reveal. I created GUI for the robotic arm with NodeRED
and then I found out that the same entity that managed this project is looking for people for another project of this type.
I really enjoyed this job so I decided to submit my resume. My mentor on behalf of this Entity asked me "Filip, have you got any publications i.e scientific articles?" I said "No, my inventions just do their job. Of course, the results of my experiments are backed with Computer Science knowledge, but an average-brained person can figure it out. What's the point of explaining basic stuff in form of a scientific article?"

## A waste of creativity

I returned home the same day, then I wrote a 2-pages long email to my friend in which I explained some op-amp-based linear power supply's principles of operation. Then I realized my creative effort is largely futile - only one person will gain knowledge from my text.
If my text was refined, eliminated chaos, and formatted correctly, my writing could clarify a lot for a much wider audience. Maybe the form of a scientific article doesn't suit me, but why not start writing a blog?

## Technical considerations

I don't like WordPress because community plugins from untrusted sources can become a threat to cybersecurity. Besides, WordPress is pretty slow compared to static websites or those written with any modern framework i.e. React.
My classmate created her blog with Jekyll so I decides to give it a shot. For now, it brings everything I need.
I'm a dedicated Obsidian user, so I learned Markup along the way. Formatting text with this language became natural for me, and Jekyll relies upon Markup heavily.
Also, a Jekyll-based blog can be hosted on GitHub pages without any burden, thus I can create my blog for free. I don't want to spend too much money on an experiment and I don't have to.

## My path

I have no pressure to write for the sake of writing, so paradoxically thanks to this I can create content of better quality, without unnecessary stuff.
I decided to get on the blogging path, stop writing for a drawer or for individuals, and start posting for the good of the community instead.
I want others to benefit from my ideas. I am in favor of sharing knowledge without limiting the rights to it through patents.
